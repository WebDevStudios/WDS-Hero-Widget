This plugin is currently under development...but is usable. 1.0 is almost ready
and should be wrapped up soon!

# WDS Hero Widget

This allows you to add "Heros" to pages with heading, subheading, and buttons.
Complete with image backgrounds, video and sliders.

## What is a Hero?

A Hero is a large area on a page where, usually, an image is shown very large
and sometimes content is in them.

### Example

*That is a hero!*

## Styling

This plugin is intended to place basic Hero's on your site intended for
additional styling by a developer.

*Though this plugin provides some basic styling, additional CSS will be required
to customize Hero's for your site.*
